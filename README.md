The Facebook Analyzer is a tool to parse and analyze a downloaded Facebook account's information for interesting statistics.

So far, we have statistics for the following:
* Wall posts by day, month and year.
* Most common words (including swear words).
* Most common profiles posting on wall.

Examples:

# Instructions:
* Download your <a href="http://www.facebook.com/help/?page=18830">facebook information</a>
* Download and unpack the Facebook Analyzer package in the same directory as your downloaded facebook information. The <code>index.html</code> file from the downloaded facebbok information files should be in the same directory as the Facebook Analyzer package's <code>fb_parser.py</code> file.
* Run <code>python fb_parser.py</code> from a shell in the above directory. Don't know what this means? Ask your child. Don't have children: ask your neighbor's children.
* Open up the `results.html` page in your browser and browse your results.

Enjoy,
Evan Carmi
